# Making Haskell look like WebAssembly

WebAssembly is a new portable low-level language meant to increase interoperability and security across the software ecosystem. In this talk, we'll explore `wasm-hs`, a domain-specific language for embedding WebAssembly in Haskell. We'll leverage Haskell's powerful type system to enforce the safety rules of WebAssembly, and we'll see how far we can overload Haskell's syntax to make it look and feel like WebAssembly.
