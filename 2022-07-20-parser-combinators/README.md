# Parser Combinators from Scratch

In this talk, we'll learn about parser combinators by implementing a small library of parsers from scratch, in Haskell, and then we'll use it to write a parser for JSON documents. We'll be using simple Haskell, with no fancy features or language extensions, so the talk is suitable for beginners.
